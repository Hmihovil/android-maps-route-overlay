This is a sample application to display a user's route on Google Maps in Android.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Replace the "MapApiKey" with the actual Google Maps API key that you obtain by going to http://code.google.com/android/add-ons/google-apis/mapkey.html

Also, from your emulator/DDMS, load the route.gpx file from the 'Emulator Control' tab.
